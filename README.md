# YT-Video-Analysis
I recently completed a project analyzing YouTube video trends from late May 2024. I used Python to examine views, likes, tags, and video duration metrics. Key insights include shorter videos receiving more likes and moderate-length videos garnering more views. It was a valuable experience in data analysis and visualization.

ðŸ“Š Highlights:

* Analyzed features like video titles, publish dates, channel info, tags, and engagement metrics.
* Found a positive correlation between views and likes.
* Observed most videos were uploaded towards the end of the week.
* Identified popular tags and their impact on views.
* Explored the effect of video duration on likes and views.

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights:

* Shorter videos get more likes; moderate-length videos attract more views.
* Tagging strategy significantly influences video visibility.
